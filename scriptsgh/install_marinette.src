app("/home/guest/Sources/Marinette/README.md","Marinette is my view on what a shell should look like in Grey Hack. She has no fancy features and won't stand out from the crowd. I've created her so there would be a shell I 100% understand and can hack on. The code is publicly available, which means you can fork, hack on and redistribute Marinette as you wish, though I generally discourage you from doing so because the code itself is very questionable :P")
